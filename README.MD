# Rock Paper Scissors Game in PHP

A mini project made when I was learning PHP
This is a Rock Paper Scissors game played with the computer.

The computer plays a random choice according to the present time and shows customized messages according to the result of the match.

A simple login page has also been implemented using hash of a pre defined password.
